Thanks to the dedication and support of my teachers at Denend Primary School and Glenrothes High School, I became the first person in my family to attend University. I studied Classics and Gaelic at Edinburgh University and taught at Harvard University before coming to University College. I have been a Research Fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung, the British Academy, and the Leverhulme Trust, and have also taught as a visiting Professor at Universities in Germany and New Zealand.
